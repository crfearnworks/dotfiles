# dotfiles
I utilize several computers on the daily, so I have a need for keeping my dotfiles centralized.

## Setup
The setup.sh script will download the necessary packages needed for customization of the shell.

## TODO
* Create symlinks in the Home directory to the real files in the repo.
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
* learn how to bootstrap the setup script
* learn how to use the setup script to install the necessary packages
* learn how to use the setup script to create the symlinks
* learn how to use the setup script to install the oh-my-zsh theme
* learn how to use the setup script to install the powerlevel10k theme
* learn how to use the setup script to install the oh-my-zsh plugins for git, vscode, terraform, ansible, and docker
